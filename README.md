<h1>Maths quiz made by Code Fighters!</h1>
<hr>
<p>The idea of our project is that the player will have to choose one out of three maths games</p>
<hr>
<h1>Game One</h1>
<p>In the first game the players will be given two numbers between 0 and 15 and has to guess their sum and will be given 3 attempts!</p>
<hr>
<h1>Game Two</h1>
<p>In the second game the player will be given two numbers between 10 and 99 and has to solve their multiplication and here too has 3 attempts!</p>
<hr>
<h1>Game Three</h1>
<p>In the third game the player will be given 10 questions that he has to answer relating to bitwise operations and yet again he has 3 attempts!</p>
